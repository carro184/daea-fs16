		 <p>Starting in the First Dynasty spanning to the Coptic period is the timeframe for the archaeological site of Kom Ombo.  This site is located in Upper Egypt, directly off of the Nile River to the East where it served as a trade route. The site consists of the Kom Ombo plain, but a major component of the site at Kom Ombo is the Kom Ombo Temple.  The Kom Ombo Temple is unique in that the temple is built for two Gods, Horus and Sobek, with separate spaces in the temple for both.  Significant finds and artifacts found at this site ranged from the early depictions of surgical tools on temple walls to numerous mummified crocodiles found within the temple structure.  Major excavations for the site occurred in 1893 by Jacques de Morgan at the earliest, and the 1920s by Edmund Vignard. Excavations in the 1960â€™s on the Kom Ombo Plain have led to efforts to preserve sites on the plain that have had pressures from the pressing urbanization of the Kom Ombo area. In present day Egypt, the Temple of Kom Ombo has remained a popular tourist stop along the Nile River.</p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The site of Kom Ombo consist of the Kom Ombo Temple and the Kom Ombo plain.  This plain does not have any significant, physical features.  However, this plain is thought to have been used to house herded animals because of the flat land with easy access to water, and the large amount of existing petroglyphs found at the site depicting numerous animals such as bovids. Scattered sites have also been found on the Kom Ombo Plain with evidence of animal bones, shells, blades, and grinding stones being a majority of the archaeological finds. As previously discussed, the Kom Ombo Plain consist of areas of sandstone, which was used in a majority of the construction of the temple within the city. </p>
<!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
			 <br>
		 <p>The temple structure at Kom Ombo had duplicate chambers for both gods. There were two offering halls, along with two entrances and two sanctuaries for each god. The temple also had a small birth house as part of the temple complex with references to the god Hathor. Additionally, the Temple of Kom Ombo also had additions made to it during the Coptic period including pylons and walls with depictions referencing Roman influence, and a small chapel area.  </p>
		 <p>A major component of the site at Kom Ombo consists of the Temple of Kom Ombo. The temple structure is unique due to the fact that the structure consists of two independent temples that exist within one conjoined temple structure.  Each independent portion is either dedicated to the god Horus or god Sobek, resulting in the temple complex having two entrances and two, separate areas to honor both gods. On the south east side of the temple, Sobek is worshiped.  Sobeck is the ancient god of the crocodiles who was thought to control the Nile River and the fertile land that goes along with it. The god Horus, who is worshiped on the north west of the temple, was part hawk that was considered to be the god of the sky. </p>

<p>Present day, much of the Temple of Kom Ombo is in a state of ruin.  Most of the temple structure is still standing, however, areas such as pylons in the temple enclosure, stairways, and artifacts are either nonexistent or left in ruin. Currently, the Kom Ombo site has a large Nubian population that was relocated here due to the formation of Lake Nasser. </p>

		 <h3>Location, Geography, and Geology</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The site of Kom Ombo is located in Upper Egypt, approximately 30 miles south of Edfu and 25 miles north of Aswan. Located directly on the east side of the Nile River, the site of Kom Ombo was an ideal location for access to water and to provide trade routes into areas such as Nubia.  The timespan of Kom Ombo ranged from the archaeological evidence found dating back to the First Dynasty to more recent additions to the Kom Ombo Temple that have Copic influences. Figure XXX shows a present day picture of the Kom Ombo Temple from the Nile River.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>The site of Kom Ombo is located in part of the Eastern Desert and also part of the Garara graben.  The Ganara graben is a depressed block of land located in between Kom Ombo and the Red Sea.  The site is part of a stretch of the Nile River that consists mostly of sandstone that works as a boundary for the site. Specifically, the Kom Ombo plain is contained by sandstone cliffs to the north at Gebel El-Silsila, and bounded by sandstone to the south. Thus, the materials from which structures at the site exist consist of the sandstone similar to what is found nearby.  The point in the Nile River where the site of Kom Ombo is located ranges in width from 350 meters at the narrowest portion, but can reach widths near 700 meters nearby.  The plain is about 20 meters above the level of the Nile River, and about 90 meters above sea level.</p>

	</figure>	
		 <p>The Kom Ombo Plain has a distinct strata of rocks covered with different layers of silt and sand. The strata consist the Eocene and Cretaceous rock.  On the north end of the Kom Ombo Plain, Eocene sea urchins can be found within the strata.  On the southern edge of the plain layers of rock consist of limestone.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>The climate of Kom Ombo is dry, desert climate.   Annual temperatures at the site of Kom Ombo range from 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  The site receives little to no precipitation throughout the entire year.</p>
		
		 <h3>Excavations and Significance of Excavation Results</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The excavations at Kom Ombo have been beneficial in providing information about the diversity and uniqueness of the site. Beyond the Kom Ombo temple itself, the artifacts and significant finds excavated have been a representation of this.  This included numerous grinding stones and animal bones found on the Kom Ombo Plain.  The large quantities of petroglyphs of animals found on the Kom Ombo Plain also provided a level of diversity and understanding to the settlements in the area.  The temple grounds at Kom Ombo was found to have mummified animal bodies including numerous crocodiles, falcons, and serpents, and a nilometer.  There is a diversity of hieroglyphs on the walls and pylons of the temple that show the diversity from both the Roman and Egyptian backgrounds.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>One of the earliest known excavations at the Temple of Kom Ombo was carried out by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.  Jacques de Morgan was a French archaeologist whose excavation was responsible for clearing out much of the debris at the temple for this site. This excavation also provided some early, minor work for preservation of the temple. </p>
		 <br>
		 <p>Another significant excavation for Kom Ombo took place in the 1920â€™s led by Edmund Vignard. These excavations were significant in that numerous petroglyphs of animals, grinding stones, blades, and deposits of animal bones were found in the Kom Ombo Plain.  Some of the items were even found scattered over the plain. In the 1960â€™s, further effort for excavations on the Kom Ombo Plain were conducted based off of the significance some of the findings of Edmund Vignard.  These efforts were instigated by pressure of installing irrigation ditches in the Kom Ombo Plain due to the increasing Nubian population in the area. There have not been any recent, significant excavations specifically at the Kom Ombo Plain or The Kom Ombo temple because of the increase in population and urbanization in the area and tourism.  </p>
				 
		  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 
		 <p>Kom Ombo is a significant archaeological site along the Nile River for both its diversity and uniqueness in the archaeology of Egypt. The Kom Ombo temple is unlike many other temples in the area due to fact that the Temple is dedicated to multiple gods.  Having a conjoined temple complex is unique compared to other temples.  The temple has two entrances, to areas to supply offerings, and two specific sanctuaries for both the god Horus and Sobek.  Beyond the temple, the Kom Ombo Plain excavations also lead to diverse site excavations that discoveries dating back to 10,000 B.C. This ultimately lead an effort in the 1960â€™s to excavate the plain due to pressures of urbanization in the area.  In present day Egypt, due to the easy access of the site right off of the Nile River, the area has become a popular tourist spot and home to a growing population.</p>
